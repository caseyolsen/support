Using The Falkonry Service
==========================

Accessing the Falkonry Service is simple. When you initially signed up for the Falkonry 
Service, a Personal account was created for you automatically. You can start using the 
service at any time to learn how to create pipelines and produce condition predictions.

Falkonry Personal Account
-------------------------

Your Personal account is intended to provide you with everything you need to experiment, 
learn and evaluate the service free of charge before you begin using it to address your 
business needs.

Every Personal account has the following limitations:

- Maximum of 4 pipelines 
- Limit of 20MB of data
- Single user only
- Other than these limitations, the Personal accounts are fully-functional, including all 
the features available in a Team account. Once you are ready to hook up the Falkonry 
Service to your own data sources and use it to generate real condition predictions without 
limitation, you can create a Team account.

Falkonry Team Accounts
----------------------

With a Team account you can create many more prediction pipelines and can share your 
account with other users. You can create a Team account after signing into your Personal 
account.

Pricing Details for Team Accounts
---------------------------------

The pricing of your Team account depends on the number of pipelines in use and the total 
amount of data. 

Managing additional Users
-------------------------

As the owner of your Team account, you have full control over other users' access to the 
account, its pipelines and data. Account owners can:

- Invite new users to the account
- Remove users from the account
- Grant and Remove ownership privileges for other users
- Track invitation status

Additionally, users with ownership privileges have the ability to:
