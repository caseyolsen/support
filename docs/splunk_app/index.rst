Falkonry Splunk App
===================

The Falkonry Splunk App allows existing Splunk customers to connect the Falkonry Service 
directly to Splunk so that the data you are already indexing in Splunk can be easily used
with Falkonry to generate valuable condition assessments. Once you open the outflow
of your Falkonry pipeline, it will continuously produce condition predictions as the data 
flows into Splunk, where you can search and visualize the results using any Splunk tools
directly.

Use the Falkonry Splunk App to work with your existing Splunk data
