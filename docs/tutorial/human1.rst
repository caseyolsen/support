Human Activity Recognition ðŸŽ¥
=============================

Overview
--------

This tutorial uses data from the `Daily and Sports Activities Data Set <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Daily+and+Sports+Activities>`_ 
from the UCI Machine Learning repository.  For this data set, human subjects had sensors 
placed at 5 locations on their bodies (each extremity and one on torso) and were recorded 
while repetitively executing 19 different activities.

Concepts covered
----------------

- Create a Falkonry Pipeline using signal data
- Upload verification examples and initiate learning cycle
- Make the pipeline "live"
- Add data to live pipeline, observe the recognized activities (condition assessments)
- Verify against known conditions

Instructions
------------

The tutorial uses 2 data files and 2 verification files below. Click links to download and use:

- Initial data loaded for pipeline creation (can also be found under the library sources
  at the time of pipeline creation):
  `activity_input_part1.csv <https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B51xEAJfLP30OVBlM29UZExKdTg>`_ 
- Verified examples for learning Sports Activity: `verification_activity_part1.csv <https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B51xEAJfLP30V1dBM0ZFWlhWSVU>`_
- New data to be used for testing prediction system: `activity_input_part2.csv <https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B51xEAJfLP30YVVxbjlYYVhoLVU>`_
- Verified examples for validating prediction system: `verification_activity_part2.csv <https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B51xEAJfLP30MFlwZWEtTk90SGM>`_
