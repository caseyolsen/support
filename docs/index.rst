About The Falkonry Service
==========================

There is tremendous value of being able to understand the condition of complex systems 
(machines, devices, people, animals, plants, weather, organizations) from data streams 
produced by those systems. The Falkonry Service was built in response to the need to make 
condition recognition ubiquitous and easily accessible by system operators. The service is 
easily added to any application that manages time-series data and does not require data 
scientists or custom software development.  

The Falkonry Service is used to transform signal data into real-time assessments of 
condition.  It is not, however, a machine learning toolkit for data scientists.  Users of 
the service simply supply it with signal data and any available examples of verified 
conditions and it will learn to recognize conditions.  Once it learns conditions it will 
recognize those conditions in new data.  As it accumulates data and additional verified 
examples, it continues to learn and improve its ability to recognize or ‘assess’ conditions.
