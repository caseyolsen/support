Falkonry Service API
====================

Who is it for?
--------------

If you want to integrate your application directly with Falkonry, then you would use this 
option. Please remember the Falkonry API is a Beta Preview. Things are subject to change, 
and there might be a few rough edges.

How do I access it?
-------------------
The Falkonry Prediction Service can be accessed via an HTTP API. You can see the 
`live API documentation <https://service.falkonry.io/api>`_ when you are authenticated 
into Falkonry. Note that you will need to login just like when you log in to the Falkonry Service.

If you wish to use the API programmatically, e.g., from the command line or from a Java 
application, then you will need to use an API token with the HTTP `Authorization` header on every request. 
You can create new or access existing API tokens in your account under the Settings > Integration view.
