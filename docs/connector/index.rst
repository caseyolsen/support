Setup and Integration
=====================

Who is it for?


If you want to integrate your application directly with Falkonry, then you can use the 
Falkonry API or client libraries. 

.. note::

  Please remember that Falkonry API is a Beta Preview. Things are subject to change, and 
  there might be a few rough edges.

Before you can use the Falkonry API you must have a Falkonry account.  Create an account 
from the `Falkonry Website <http://falkonry.com/start>`_.  Additionally, this document 
assumes knowledge of `Falkonry AI concepts <../concepts.html>`_ and the Falkonry UI.

creating a pipeline or uploading source data, you currently have a number of choices besides
the `Falkonry UI <../concepts.html>`_ and `Falkonry Splunk App <../splunk_app/index.html>`_:
