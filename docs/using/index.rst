Accessing the Falkonry Service
==============================

There are two ways to deploy and use the Falkonry Service depending on your specific 
business needs and requirements.

Service Cloud
-------------

The simplest way to get immediate and effortless access to the Falkonry service is to take 
advantage of our hosted Falkonry Service via your Falkonry account. This allows you to 
focus on creating and refining your pipelines while leaving the infrastructure management 
and maintenance to us.

When you initially signed up, a free Personal account was created for you to experiment 
and learn about the Falkonry service. If our cloud deployment is adequate for your needs, 
the next step is to create a Team account and obtain expanded access the service.

Service Accounts

Falkonry provides isolated personal use as well as collaboration workspaces through its
feature called Service Accounts.
