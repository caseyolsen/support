Accessing the Falkonry Service
======================

There are two ways to deploy and use the Falkonry Service depending on your specific 
business needs and requirements.

Falkonry Service Cloud
----------------------

The simplest way to get immediate and effortless access to the Falkonry service is to take 
advantage of our hosted Falkonry Service via your Falkonry account. This allows you to 
focus on creating and refining your pipelines while leaving the infrastructure management 
and maintenance to us.

When you initially signed up, a free Personal account was created for you to experiment 
and learn about the Falkonry service. If our cloud deployment is adequate for your needs, 
the next step is to create a Team account and continue to access the service without 
limitations for production use. 

Falkonry Service Private Deployment
-----------------------------------

The Falkonry Service can be accessed in the Cloud as well as installed for an exclusive
deployment.
