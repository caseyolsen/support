Test
====

The test tab provides a flexible way to test the accuracy of each model against different sets of data. 

In order to use the test tab, the user must have already created a model revision in the `learn <./learn.html>`_ tab. If multiple revisions exist, the user is able to choose which revision to test. Then the user will add another data set with verification. Based on the first model, Falkonry will generalize the new data and produce results similarly to the monitor tab.

Unlike the monitor tab, the test tab allows testing multiple sets of data that do not follow the time stamp of previous data. Also, Falkonry cannot learn from the results of a test.

Here is an example of creating tests with the Human Activity Data:
