Test
====

The test tab gives you a flexible way to test the accuracy of each model against different sets of data. 

In order to use the test tab, you must have already created a model revision in the `learn <./learn.html>`_ tab. If you have multiple revisions, you are able to choose which one you want to test. Based on the first model, Falkonry will generalize the new data similarly to the monitor tab.

Unlike the monitor tab, you can test multiple sets of data that do not follow the time stamp of previous data. Also, Falkonry cannot learn from the results of a test.

Here is an example of creating tests with the Human Activity Data:
