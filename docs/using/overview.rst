Overview
========

Falkonry ingests raw `data <./data.html>`_ to create assessments of condition that allow it to generalize additional data. To use the Falkonry service, the user must first create a datastream to hold the uploaded data sets.  When the datastream is complete, the user directs Falkonry to `learn <./learn.html>`_ and create a model revision. The model will not know the names of the conditions until `facts <./fact.html>`_ are added. With a complete model, the user is able to test additional data sets. Then the user opens the pipeline in the `configure <./configure.html>`_ tab and uploads more data. The results can be viewed in the `monitor <./monitor.html>`_ tab.
