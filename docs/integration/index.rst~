Integration
===========

REST API
--------

This document will focus on using the Falkonry REST API and will explore two different 
ways to access it: 

  - Falkonry Service API page - This is an interactive web page which allows you to easily 
    examine and test the various UI functions.
  - Programmatic API use - Use of the API programmatically from your application. 

When using the API programmatically, e.g., from the command line or from a Java 
application, you will need to use an API token obtained from the Falkonry Service UI. 

You can generate an API Token from the **Account** Settings for **Integration**. This screen
allows you to generate as many different tokens as you wish. The name of the token
is used to identify the user that performs API actions.

This token will be used in HTTP requests that are sent to Falkonry in the rest of this 
document.

Prebuilt Connectors
-------------------

Falkonry Splunk App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Falkonry Splunk App allows existing Splunk customers to connect the Falkonry Service 
directly to Splunk so that the data you are already indexing in Splunk can be easily used
with Falkonry to generate valuable condition assessments. Once you open the outflow
of your Falkonry pipeline, it will continuously produce condition predictions as the data 
flows into Splunk, where you can search and visualize the results using any Splunk tools
directly.

Use the Falkonry Splunk App to work with your existing Splunk data

Build Your Own Connectors
-------------------------

Who is it for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to integrate your application directly with Falkonry, then you can use the 
Falkonry API or client libraries. 

.. note::

  Please remember that Falkonry API is a Beta Preview. Things are subject to change, and 
  there might be a few rough edges.

Before you can use the Falkonry API you must have a Falkonry account.  Create an account 
from the `Falkonry Website <http://falkonry.com/start>`_.  Additionally, this document 
assumes knowledge of `Falkonry AI concepts <../concepts.html>`_ and the Falkonry UI.
